# CNN-model-to-classify-images-of-plastic-waste
This project is part of my Shell-Edunet AICTE internship, focusing on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plastic waste images. The goal is to enhance waste management by accurately identifying different types of plastic for efficient recycling.
